# This file contains the configuration for the `make compile-sc` command.
# It will be read by the code under scripts/cmd/compilecs to compile and
# generate go bindings for all the smart contracts required for our tests
# and deployments. Internally, the code use docker containers for all its
# operations, so that there is no need to install any additional tool
# besides docker.

# The configuration in this file is composed of a set of compile units, each
# compile unit describes how to compile a solidity contract or set of them
# under the same directory. They have the following fields:
# * name: identifier of the compile unit, it can be the name of a smart
#   contract or a directory containing more than one.
# * solcVersion: tag to use for the ethereum/solc docker image to be used to
#   compile the code
# * inputPath: where to find the contract relative to test/contracts
# * outputPath: where to put the compile and bindings generation results
#   relative to test/contracts/bin
#
# The compile units are grouped into two sets:
# * parallel: all the compile units under this key will be compiled in parallel
# * sequential: all the compile units under this key will be compiled
#   sequentially in the given order.
