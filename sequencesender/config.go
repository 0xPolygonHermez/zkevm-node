	// GasOffset is the amount of gas to be added to the gas estimation in order
	// to provide an amount that is higher than the estimated one. This is used
	// to avoid the TX getting reverted in case something has changed in the network
	// state after the estimation which can cause the TX to require more gas to be
	// executed.

	// gas estimation: 1000
